abstract: >
    <p>We explore the combination of smartwatches and a large interactive display to support visual data analysis. 
     These two extremes of interactive surfaces are increasingly popular, but feature different characteristics---display and input modalities, personal/public use, performance, and portability.</p>
    <p>With this demonstration, we present our conceptual framework and its implementation, which enables analysts to explore data items using both devices in combination.
     Building on a analysis scenario for convicted crimes in Baltimore, our demonstration gives an impression of how the device combination can allow users to develop complex insights more fluidly by leveraging the device roles.</p>
