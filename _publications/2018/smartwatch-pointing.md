abstract: >
    <p>In this work, we present the design and evaluation of a smartwatch-based mid-air pointing and clicking interaction technique called *Twist, Point, and Tap*, or short *TPT*.
       Incorporating only commodity devices, we aim to provide a fast and error-prone pointing approach that can easily be deployed to existing environments with a shared display, e.g., meeting rooms or public info points.
       Detected by internal sensors, TPT maps horizontal forearm movements as well as wrist rotation to relative cursor movements on a nearby large display.
       Left and right-click interactions are supported through tapping on the smartwatch's touchscreen.</p>
       <p>By running a Fitts's law study, we compared our TPT concept against an existing smartwatch-based pointing technique called Watchpoint.
       The study revealed that the TPT concept has a smaller error rate while maintaining a comparable performance.</p>
