abstract: >
    We present VISTILES, a conceptual framework that uses a set of mobile devices to distribute and coordinate visualization views for the exploration of multivariate data.
    In contrast to desktop-based interfaces for information visualization, mobile devices offer the potential to provide a dynamic and user-defined interface supporting co-located collaborative data exploration with different individual workflows.
    As part of our framework, we contribute concepts that enable users to interact with coordinated & multiple views (CMV) that are distributed across several mobile devices.
    The major components of the framework are:
        (i) dynamic and flexible layouts for CMV focusing on the distribution of views and
        (ii) an interaction concept for smart adaptations and combinations of visualizations utilizing explicit side-by-side arrangements of devices.
    As a result, users can benefit from the possibility to combine devices and organize them in meaningful spatial layouts.
    Furthermore, we present a web-based prototype implementation as a specific instance of our concepts.
    This implementation provides a practical application case enabling users to explore a multivariate data collection.
    We also illustrate the design process including feedback from a preliminary user study, which informed the design of both the concepts and the final prototype.
