abstract: >
    <p>We demonstrate the prototype of the conceptual VisTiles framework.
       VisTiles allows exploring multivariate data sets by using multiple coordinated views that are distributed across a set of mobile devices.
       This setup allows users to benefit from dynamic and user-defined interface arrangements and to easily initiate co-located data exploration sessions.</p>
       <p>The current web-based prototype runs on commodity devices and is able to determine the spatial device arrangement by either a cross-device pinch gesture or an external tracking system.
       Multiple data sets are provided that can be explored by different visualizations (e.g., scatterplots, parallel coordinate plots, stream graphs).
       With this demonstration, we showcase the general concepts of VisTiles and discuss ideas for enhancements as well the potential for application cases beyond data analysis.</p>

## Accompanying Demonstration to our Full Paper
This is the accompanying demonstration of our TVCG 2018 full paper [*VisTiles: Coordinating and Combining Co-located Mobile Devices for Visual Data Exploration*](/publications/2018/vistiles/).
Please cite the full paper when referencing this work.
During the ACM AVI 2018 conference, the demo will be shown on Wednesday evening (May 30).
