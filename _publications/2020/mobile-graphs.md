    <p>
    Mobile devices are getting more and more powerful, however, interfaces for exploring multivariate network data on-the-go remain rare and challenging to realize.
    In this work, we present considerations as well as concepts on how to enable such exploration on mobile devices.
    Specifically, we discuss that an interface with force-directed node-link representation alongside additional views for investigating multivariate aspects and filter functionalities seems promising.
    Further, such an interface could be advanced by incorporating multiple mobile devices in parallel.
    As part of our on going investigations, we have realized an early prototype indicating the general feasibility of our concepts.
