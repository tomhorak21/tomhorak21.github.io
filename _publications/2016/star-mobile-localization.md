abstract: >
    Technologies for spatial and proxemic interaction with mobile devices depend inherently on the ability to obtain information on the device’s position (i.e., to localize the device). Numerous technologies have been proposed for this, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, but deciding which one to use in a particular context is challenging. In this paper, we examine current technologies for the localization of mobile devices and categorize them into a taxonomy based on their technological similarity. By considering numerous properties (e.g., precision, battery usage, scalability, required infrastructure, deployment) and discussing how these impact usability in different scenarios, we aim to allow other researchers informed decisions on the localization techniques to use for a particular application case.
