abstract: >
    We present a concept for tangible visualization views using colocated,     spatially-aware mobile devices. The proposed concept takes advantage of ad-hoc device combinations and spatial arrangements, allowing users to interact with multiple coordinated visualization views distributed across mobile displays. In this work, we describe the basics of this concept and illustrate the potential of our approach by describing and implementing use cases of various visualization techniques.
