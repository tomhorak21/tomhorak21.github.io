title: Content Sharing Between Spatially-Aware Mobile Phones and Large Vertical Displays Supporting Collaborative Work

abstract: >
    Large vertical displays are increasingly widespread, and content sharing between them and personal mobile devices is central to many collaborative usage scenarios. In this chapter we present FlowTransfer, bidirectional transfer techniques which make use of the mobile phoneâ€™s position and orientation. We focus on three main aspects: multi-item transfer and layout, the dichotomy of casual versus precise interaction, and support for physical navigation. Our five techniques explore these aspects in addition to being contributions in their own right. They leverage physical navigation, allowing seamless transitions between different distances to the display, while also supporting arranging content and copying entire layouts within the transfer process. This is enabled by a novel distance-dependent pointing cursor that supports coarse pointing from distance as well as precise positioning at close range. We fully implemented all techniques and conducted a qualitative study documenting their benefits. Finally, based on a literature review and our holistic approach in designing the techniques, we also contribute an analysis of the underlying design space.
