abstract: >
    Due to the deployment of novel interaction techniques, additional challenges for logging purposes in information visualizations arise. In this position paper, we discuss specific challenges regarding four different example setups illustrated with projects of our own. In each setup, various aspects need to be considered to enable, e.g., a meaningful logging of (multiple) input streams or the replaying of logs. We do not aim to provide a technical solution for logging interaction in the various setups, but rather want to share our insights and experiences from a set of projects that apply novel interaction techniques and multi-display setups to visualizations.

## LIVVIL Workshop
This work was presented as part of the *Workshop on Logging Interactive Visualizations & Visualizing Interaction Logs (LIVVIL)* workshop. More information about the workshop as well as the outcome is available under [livvil.github.io/workshop](https://livvil.github.io/workshop/).

All papers of the workshop were presented within a 7 minute talk. [My slides can be accessed here]({{page.slides}}).
