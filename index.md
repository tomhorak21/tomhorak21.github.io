# Hi, I'm Tom Horak!

Iâ€™m a research associate / Ph.D. student at the Interactive Media Lab Dresden since February 2016.
In my research, I focus on utilizing multi-device environments for visual data exploration, i.e., investigating ways how people can work with interactive visualizations across different devices.

Nowadays, we are often surrounded by a multitude of devices---smartwatches, smartphones, tablets, desktops, TVs, projectors, and many more.
However, we only use one device at a time.
I'm interested in how we can exploit the potential of using devices in combination, especially in the context of data exploration.
