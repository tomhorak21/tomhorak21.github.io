I visited Niklas Elmqvist and Karthik Badam to push our collaboration forward.

After Karthik already visited our Lab in August, it was now my turn. For three days, we brainstormed about the use of multiple devices for co-located collaborative sensemaking setting the foundation for our young collaboration.
