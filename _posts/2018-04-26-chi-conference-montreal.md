title: "Attended 2018 ACM CHI Conference in Montreal, QC, Canada"
---

For the first time, I participated in the [ACM CHI conference](http://chi2018.acm.org) and also presented my first CHI paper.

The [*When David meets Goliath*](/publications/2018/david-meets-goliath/) paper was the result of cooperation with Karthik Badam and Niklas Elmqvist from the University of Maryland.
At CHI, Karthik and I gave a shared presentation in the *Visualizations Beyond the Desktop* session on Tuesday.
The highlight was, of course, receiving the **Honorable Mention Award** for this paper! 
Further, we also presented a [demonstration](/publications/2018/david-meets-goliath-demo/) of our paper on Monday evening.

On Saturday, I also participated in the [Data Visualization on Mobile Devices](https://mobilevis.github.io/) workshop and shared my thoughts on [hierarchical graphs](/publications/2018/hierarchical-graphs). 
All in all, CHI was a great experience and I'm especially happy to have seen so many known faces again and also to have met a lot of new people.
