Yeah! Both the [*VisTiles* paper](/publications/2018/vistiles/) and my [poster on *Value Driver Trees*](/publications/2017/value-driver-trees/) were accepted at this years InfoVis.

I'm really happy that both submissions made it.
Wit my master thesis as starting point, the *VisTiles* project now, finally, will be published as a journal paper:
[*VisTiles: Coordinating and Combining Co-located Mobile Devices for Visual Data Exploration*](/publications/2018/vistiles/) by Ricardo Langner, me, and Raimund Dachselt.
With the poster, [*Improving Value Driver Trees to Enhance Business Data Analysis*](/publications/2017/value-driver-trees/), I'm able to present first concepts for a specific application case of multivariate graphs.
I'm really looking forward to the discussions during the poster session!

See you at the [IEEE VIS 2017](http://ieeevis.org/) in Phoenix (Oct 1-6)!
