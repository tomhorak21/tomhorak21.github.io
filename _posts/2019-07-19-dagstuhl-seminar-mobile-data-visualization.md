title: "Participated in the Dagstuhl Seminar on Mobile Data Visualization"
---

This July I was invited to attended the [Dagstuhl Seminar on Mobile Data Visualization](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=19292) and happily accepted the invitation.

Dagstuhl is a castle serving as German research center an is well known for it's high-profile, invitation-only seminars.
The week long seminar was organized by Eun Kyoung Choe (University of Maryland), Raimund Dachselt (TU Dresden), Petra Isenberg (INRIA), and Bongshin Lee (Microsoft Research) and had 25 participants in total.
During the week, many interesting discussions sparked around the topic of mobile data visualization with input from visualization, HCI, and UbiComp researchers as well as practitioners.
I'm extremely delighted that I got the chance to participate as well and am looking forward to possible follow-ups.
