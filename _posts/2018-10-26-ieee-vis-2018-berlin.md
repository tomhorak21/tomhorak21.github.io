title: "Attended the 2018 IEEE VIS Conference in Berlin, Germany"
---

After 2016 and 2017, I again participated in the [IEEE VIS conference](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/welcome) and presented a poster.

My third VIS was conveniently located in Berlin this year (and it's also only the second time VIS happened in Europe!). 
Similar to the years before, I served as a Student Volunteer and presented a poster ([*Comparing Rendering Performance of Common Web Technologies for Large Graphs*](/publications/2018/graph-performance/)), however, I was not involved in a paper this year.
The conference was a again a great and inspiring event with tons of impressions and interesting discussions with both old and new friends.

Looking forward to VIS in Vancouver next year!
