title: Attended 2016 ACM ISS conference in Niagara Falls, ON, Canada

For the third year in a row, I participated at the ACM ISS conference (formerly ACM ITS).

On Sunday, Ulrich von Zadow presented [our position paper](/publications/2016/star-mobile-localization) at the cross-surface workshop.
The next day, I presented my poster *Presenting Business Data: Challenges during Board Meetings in Multi-Display Environments* during the poster night. For more information, check out [the poster page](/publications/2016/presenting-business-data).
