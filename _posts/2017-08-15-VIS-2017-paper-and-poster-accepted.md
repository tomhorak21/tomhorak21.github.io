Yeah! Both the [*VisTiles* paper](/publications/2017/vistiles/) and the [poster on *Value Driver Trees*](/publications/2017/value-driver-trees/) were accepted at this year's InfoVis.

I'm really happy that both submissions made it.
The *VisTiles* project---once started with my master thesis---will be published as a journal paper in TVCG:
[*VisTiles: Coordinating and Combining Co-located Mobile Devices for Visual Data Exploration*](/publications/2017/vistiles/).

With the poster ([*Improving Value Driver Trees to Enhance Business Data Analysis*](/publications/2017/value-driver-trees/)), we're able to present first concepts for a specific application case of multivariate graphs.
I'm really looking forward to the discussions during the poster session!

See you at the [IEEE VIS 2017](http://ieeevis.org/) in Phoenix (Oct 1-6)!
