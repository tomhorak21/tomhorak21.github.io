title: "Attended 2017 IEEE VIS Conference in Phoenix, AZ, USA"
---

For the second time, I participated in the [IEEE VIS conference](http://ieeevis.org/)---this year, with two own contributions.

With [*VisTiles*](/publications/2018/vistiles/), I had my very first InfoVis paper this year!
My colleague Ricardo Langner did a great job in presenting our paper, while I had the pleasure to give the fast-forward presentation.
Further, I presented a poster [on business data analysis with *Value Driver Trees*](/publications/2017/value-driver-trees/).
I'm really happy that both our paper and poster received good feedback.
 
Notably, VIS was in general about the ''second time'' for me this year:
second time at VIS, second time student volunteer (this year as day captain, though), second time presenting a poster ([last year's poster](/publications/2016/combining-mobiles/) became this year's VisTiles paper!), and second time giving a fast-forward.
Thanks to all this and, of course, a manifold program, VIS was again an exciting week with a ton of impressions and a great community.
