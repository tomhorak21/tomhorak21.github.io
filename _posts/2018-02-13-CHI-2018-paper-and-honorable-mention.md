title: "CHI 2018: Paper Accepted & Honorable Mention Award"
---

Our [*David meets Goliath* paper](/publications/2018/david-meets-goliath/) was accepted at CHI '18 and received an honorable mention award!

The paper is the result of a successful cooperation with Karthik Badam and Niklas Elmqvist from the University of Maryland.
It is focused on the combination of smartwatches with a large interactive display for visual data exploration.
I'm really proud that we were able to also receive the honorable mention award, the paper is under the top 5% of over 2.500 submissions!
At CHI, we will present a demonstration to our paper on Monday night.

The [ACM CHI 2018](https://chi2018.acm.org/) conference will take place in Montreal from April 21 to 26.
