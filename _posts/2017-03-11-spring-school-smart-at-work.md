Being _smart@work_: experience from the International Spring School on Human Technology Cooperation.

I was involved in the organization team of the International Spring School on Human Technology Cooperation “smart@work”, which was held at the Technischen Universität Dresden from March 5 to 11.
With 22 participating Ph.D. students and Post-Docs from 15 different countries, 3 inspiring keynotes, and cool workshops as well as additional talks, it was an exciting experience with manifold impressions.
More information about the Spring School can be found under [smartatwork.org](http://smartatwork.org/) as well as in the [news at IML's webpage](https://imld.de/en/news/2017/03/erfolgreicher-abschluss-der-internationalen-spring-school-smartwork/).
