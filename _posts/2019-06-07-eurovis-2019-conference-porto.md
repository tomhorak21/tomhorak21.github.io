title: "Attended the 2019 EG/VGTC EuroVis Conference in Porto, Portugal"
---

This year, I attended the [EG/VGTC EuroVis conference](https://www.eurovis.org/) and presented the *InsideInsights* paper.

[*InsideInsights*](/publications/2019/insideinsights/) is the result of a cooperation of Andreas Mathisen, Clemens N. Klokmose, and Kaj Groenbaek from Aarhus University, Niklas Elmqvist from the University of Maryland as well as myself.
Similar to Vistribute, the paper is a result of [my research visit in Maryland last year](/2018/09/24/wrapping-up-research-visit-at-umd).
The InsideInsights paper was presented together with Andreas Mathisen at EuroVis on Thursday.
