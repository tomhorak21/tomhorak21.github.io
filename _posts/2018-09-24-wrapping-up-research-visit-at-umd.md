title: "Wrapping up my Research Visit at University of Maryland"
---

After almost six months, it's time to wrap up a great stay at [UMD](http://ischool.umd.edu/), where I worked with Niklas Elmqvist.

Time has passed so quickly; it feels like yesterday that I arrived here in College Park in early April.
But the time was definitely well spent, as it involved a ton of brainstorming, discussion, as well as writing---and finally climaxed when submitting to the ACM CHI conference last week.
Working closely with [Niklas](https://sites.umiacs.umd.edu/elm/) at the HCIL was a great experience on both a professional and a personal level---thanks for everything, Niklas!

All in all, it was awesome to meet so many new people here and experience a pretty different environment than I'm used to.
Nevertheless, I'm also looking forward to returning home now and seeing my family, friends, and colleagues again.
