title: Attended 2016 IEEE VIS conference in Baltimore, MD, USA
---

For the first time, I attended the IEEE VIS conference this year. It was a great experience!

I participated in the *Logging Interactive Visualizations & Visualizing Interaction Logs* Workshop (*LIVVIL*) and presented [our position paper](/publications/2016/logging-in-visualizations). My personal highlight was, of course, to receive an **honorable mention** for the *Towards Combining Mobile Devices for Visual Data Exploration* poster from Ricardo Langner, Raimund Dachselt and me!  For more information, check out [my poster page](/publications/2016/combining-mobiles).
