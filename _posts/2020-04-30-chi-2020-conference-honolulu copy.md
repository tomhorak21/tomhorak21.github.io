title: "Full Paper at the 2020 ACM CHI Conference"
---

The *Watch+Strap* paper was published in the proceedings of the [2020 ACM CHI conference](http://chi2020.acm.org).

[*Watch+Strap*](/publications/2020/watchstrap/) was authored together with Konstantin Klamka and Raimund Dachselt and focuses on how to extend smartwatches with interactive StrapDisplays.
For CHI, the paper was accepted and scheduled to be presented at the conference in Honolulu, Hawaii, US. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference itself had to be canceled and our paper is now published in the proceedings without presentation.
Together with Konstantin, we still recorded the paper talk and provide this on the [project webpage](https://imld.de/watch+strap).

Similarly to last year, I was again [part of the organizing committee](https://chi2020.acm.org/organizing/) and served as a Data & PCS co-chair.
In addition, I co-chaired the German community efforts around the German HCI, which showcased the German publications at the conference: [germanhci.de](https://germanhci.de)

Next year, the [CHI conference](https://chi2021.acm.org/) will take place in Yokohama, Japan from May 8-13, 2021.
