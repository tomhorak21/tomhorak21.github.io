title: "Attended 2019 ACM CHI Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, UK"

I again participated in the [ACM CHI conference](http://chi2019.acm.org) by presenting *Vistribute* and attending the Doctoral Consortium.

The [*Vistribute*](/publications/2019/vistribute/) paper was the result of a cooperation of me and Raimund Dachselt from the Interactive Media Lab with Andreas Mathisen and Clemens N. Klokmose from Aarhus University as well as Niklas Elmqvist from the University of Maryland.
At CHI, I gave the paper talk in the *Displays, Devices, and Interaction for Visualization* session on Tuesday.
The paper is the direct result of [my research visit in Maryland last year](/2018/09/24/wrapping-up-research-visit-at-umd) and was my second CHI paper in a row, following last years [*David meets Goliath* paper](/publications/2018/david-meets-goliath/) (which also resulted from a collaboration with Niklas Elmqvist).

On Saturday and Sunday, I also participated [in the Doctoral Consortium (DC)](https://chi2019.acm.org/authors/doctoral-consortium/).
With 19 other Ph.D. students, we presented the current progress of the different dissertation project, exchanged ideas and experiences, and discussed the challenges we are facing.
I'm really happy I got the opportunity to be a part of the DC.  

Next year, CHI will take place in Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA from April 25 to 30. Similarly to this year, I'm again [part of the organizing committee](https://chi2020.acm.org/organizing/) and serving as a Data & PCS co-chair.
