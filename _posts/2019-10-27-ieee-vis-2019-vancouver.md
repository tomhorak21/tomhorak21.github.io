title: "Attended the 2019 IEEE VIS Conference in Vancouver, Canada"
---

As the years before, I attended the annual [IEEE VIS conference](http://ieeevis.org/year/2019/welcome) in 2019 in Vancouver.

This year, VIS took place at Canada's west coast, in the city of Vancouver. 
For the fourth time, I served as a Student Volunteer at the conference and enjoyed the extensive program.
Although I haven't presented my own work, the conference was an inspiring event with manifold impressions.

Next year, VIS will be in Salt Lake City.
