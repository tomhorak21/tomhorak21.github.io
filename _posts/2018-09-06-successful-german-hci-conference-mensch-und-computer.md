title: "Successful German HCI Conference 'Mensch und Computer' 2018"
---

The ['Mensch und Computer'](http://muc2018.mensch-und-computer.de/en/) conference, where I served as Workshop Chair, took place in Dresden this week.

The conference counts as one the biggest HCI conference in Europe and was organized by Prof. Weber and Prof. Dachselt from the Technische Universit√§t Dresden this year.
I myself got the chance to serve as Workshop Chair together with Marius Brade from the University of Applied Science Dresden, which was an interesting experience.
With 19 accepted workshops, the conference offered a big hands-on part alongside with interesting paper sessions, tutorials, and a practitioner track.

Finally, together with a former student from the Interactive Media Lab, Javid Abbasov, we were able to present an own poster on *[Smartwatch-based Pointing Interaction](/publications/2018/smartwatch-pointing/)* at the conference.
