title: Started Working on Research Project GEMS 2.0
---

Since July 2017, I'm now officially working on the DFG-funded research project on multivariate graphs.

The GEMS 2.0 project focuses on **Visual Editing and Comparison of Multivariate Graphs Using Multiple Interactive Displays**.
It is a follow-up of the *GEMS* (*Graph Exploration and Manipulation on interactive Surfaces*) project and, again, a cooperation between the Interactive Media Lab Dresden at the Technische Universität Dresden and the Chair of Computer Graphics (VC²G) at the University of Rostock.
More information about the project can be found on [the corresponding project page of the Interactive Media Lab](https://imld.de/en/research/research-projects/visuelles-editieren-und-vergleich-multivariater-graphen-in-interaktiven-multi-display-umgebungen-gems-2-0/).
