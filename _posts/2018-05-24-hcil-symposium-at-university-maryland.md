title: "Attended the 35th HCIL Symposium at the University of Maryland"
---

As I'm currently staying at the HCIL, I was able to attended the [HCIL Symposium](http://hcil.umd.edu/events/event/hcil-annual-symposium/) at the University of Maryland.

The symposium gives interesting insights in the manifold activities of the HCIL to a mixed audience of practitioners and researchers. 
I presented a poster by myself on my recent activities with *Multi-Display Environments for Visual Data Exploration*, specifically I talked about the [*When David meets Goliath*](/publications/2018/david-meets-goliath/) project as well as the [*VisTiles*](/publications/2018/vistiles) projects.
