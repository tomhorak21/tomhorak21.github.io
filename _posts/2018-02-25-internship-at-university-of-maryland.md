title: "Internship at the University of Maryland iSchool"
---

I'm really excited working with Niklas Elmqvist during an internship from April until September this year.

With its expertise in information visualization, the [UMD iSchool](http://ischool.umd.edu) (or University of Maryland College of Information Studies) is an excellent address to extend my research on multivariate graphs.
The internship is a spin-off of the existing collaboration between the Interactive Media Lab and the iSchool, which just recently resulted in the [awarded CHI paper *When David meets Goliath*](/publications/2018/david-meets-goliath/).
I'm eagerly looking forward to my stay!
