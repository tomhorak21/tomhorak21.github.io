title: "Co-Organized the Virtual German CHI Week"
---

I was involved in the organization of the [Virtual German CHI Week](https://www.germanhci.de/events/2020-virtual-chi/), which aimed to partly substitute this year's canceled ACM CHI conference.

As a joint effort with other researchers from Germany, the Virtual German CHI Week featured presentations and discussions of over 100 CHI publications of the German community.
For each day of the week, three consecutive sessions were scheduled between 17:00 and 19:00 were authors got the chance to shortly present their paper and answering questions from the audience live.
The event was hosted via Zoom and live-streamed on YouTube, attracting up to 200 parallel viewers.
More details can be found on the events web page on [germanhci.de](https://www.germanhci.de/events/2020-virtual-chi/).

This event was a unique experience that was formed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancelation of the ACM CHI conference, the premier venue for Human-Computer Interaction research.
