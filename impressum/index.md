I’m a research associate / Ph.D. student at the [Interactive Media Lab Dresden](https://imld.de/en/) since February 2016.
In my research, I'm focusing on bringing novel interaction techniques to information visualizations.

In 2013, I received my Bachelors degree in media computer science from Technische Universität Dresden, Germany.
I continued my studies in Dresden and defended my Master thesis in December 2015.
Two months later, I got the opportunity to start as a PhD student supervised by Raimund Dachselt.
