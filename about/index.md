# About me
I’m a research associate / Ph.D. student at the [Interactive Media Lab Dresden](https://imld.de/en/) since February 2016.
In my research, I focus on bringing novel interaction techniques to information visualizations.
My supervisor is [Prof. Raimund Dachselt](https://imld.de/~dachselt/).
Currently, I'm working on a research project called *GEMS 2.0* about *Visual Editing and Comparison of Multivariate Graphs Using Multiple Interactive Displays* founded by the DFG (largest independent research funding organisation in Germany).
The project is a cooperation between the Interactive Media Lab Dresden at the Technische Universität Dresden and the [Chair of Computer Graphics (VC²G)](http://vcg.informatik.uni-rostock.de/) at the University of Rostock.

In 2013, I received my Bachelors degree in media computer science from Technische Universität Dresden, Germany.
I continued my studies in Dresden and defended my Master thesis in December 2015.
Two months later, I got the opportunity to start as a PhD student supervised by Raimund Dachselt.
